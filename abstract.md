Spatial-temporal renewable scenario generation using GANs for climate impact assessment

Key contribution:
1. Conditional GANs with temperature data.
2. Exploring the computational limits of spatial-temporal resolutions and size
3. Include limited scenario forecast with global warming effect: increased temperature conditions
4. Exploring better spatial connections than simply maintaining spatial correlations
