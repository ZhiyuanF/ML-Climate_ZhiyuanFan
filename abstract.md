Increase Renewable Data Temporal Resolution Using Conditional GANs

Zhiyuan Fan - zf2198

Key target and contribution:

1. Verification of methodology for GANs to increase renewable data temporal resolution
with daily average input: both 5-mins and hourly
2. 5-mins test run successfully with minor convergence issue due to unevenly distributed
data 
3. hourly test run not successful due to data set up (confirmed) and loss function 
selection (to be explored)
