Concept of the project determined:
Generate synthetic data of renewable energy input (wind/solar) for energy system modeling
The data is idealy a complicated spatio-temparol time-series. Not yet sure whether daily or houly

Added references about:
1. Why not adding hydrogen predictions along with solar/wind
2. GANs the most mature and sucessful model so far
3. Diffusion model the current edge research direction, no publication so far

Data aquired from previous publications: daily data for Texas.

Added code and Excel about how to fetch weather data 
(including temperature data) from public database.
Confirmed that although the data time series resolution is suitable for the study
it need extra spatial resolution and processing
