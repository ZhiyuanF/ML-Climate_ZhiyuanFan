Concept of the project determined:
Generate synthetic data of renewable energy input (wind/solar) for energy system modeling
The data is idealy a complicated spatio-temparol time-series. Not yet sure whether daily or houly

Added references about:
1. Why not adding hydrogen predictions along with solar/wind
2. GANs the most mature and sucessful model so far
3. Diffusion model the current edge research direction, no publication so far

Data aquired from previous publications: daily data for Texas.
